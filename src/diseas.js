    "ADHD": {
      "symptoms": "Individuals with ADD/ADHD often experience difficulty sustaining attention, making them easily distracted by external stimuli. They may struggle with forgetfulness in daily tasks and exhibit signs of restlessness, frequently fidgeting or moving excessively. Impulsivity is another common symptom, leading to difficulties in waiting their turn or interrupting conversations. Organizing tasks can be challenging, often resulting in careless mistakes in school or work. Tasks that require prolonged mental effort are often avoided, and these individuals may frequently misplace important items.",
      "causes": "The exact causes of ADD/ADHD are not fully understood, but research suggests that genetics play a significant role, as the condition often runs in families. Differences in brain structure and function, particularly in areas controlling attention and impulse regulation, have also been observed. Environmental factors, such as prenatal exposure to toxins like lead, low birth weight, and premature birth, may contribute to the development of ADD/ADHD. Additionally, maternal substance use during pregnancy and imbalances in neurotransmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine are believed to influence the condition.",
      "types": "ADD/ADHD is classified into three main types. The Predominantly Inattentive Presentation, formerly known as ADD, is characterized mainly by inattention without significant hyperactivity. The Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Presentation involves excessive fidgeting, difficulty staying still, and impulsive decision-making. The Combined Presentation includes both inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms, making it the most commonly diagnosed form of the disorder.",
      "diagnosis": "Diagnosing ADD/ADHD involves a comprehensive clinical assessment based on the DSM-5 criteria. A detailed history is gathered from parents, teachers, and the patient to evaluate symptom patterns over time. Behavioral and psychological assessments help rule out other conditions such as anxiety, depression, or learning disabilities that may mimic ADHD symptoms. Clinicians often use standardized rating scales and questionnaires, such as the Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Rating Scale or the Conners' Rating Scale, to assess symptom severity and functional impairment.",
      "treatment": "Treatment for ADD/ADHD typically includes a combination of behavioral therapy, medication, and lifestyle modifications. Behavioral interventions, such as cognitive behavioral therapy and social skills training, help individuals develop coping mechanisms and self-regulation strategies. Parent training programs educate caregivers on managing ADHD-related behaviors effectively. Classroom interventions, including individualized education plans (IEPs), provide structured support for students. Medications, such as stimulants like methylphenidate and amphetamines, or non-stimulants like atomoxetine, are commonly prescribed to improve focus and impulse control. Lifestyle modifications, such as maintaining a structured daily routine, engaging in regular physical activity, and ensuring a balanced diet, also contribute to symptom management. Counseling and psychotherapy may be beneficial, particularly for individuals experiencing co-occurring conditions like anxiety or depression.",
      "prevention": "While ADD/ADHD cannot always be prevented, certain measures may reduce the risk of its development. Prenatal care is crucial, as avoiding exposure to harmful substances during pregnancy can help protect brain development. Early intervention programs for children at risk may support cognitive and behavioral growth. Providing a structured and supportive environment, both at home and in school, helps children develop self-discipline and coping strategies. Encouraging regular physical activity and a well-balanced diet supports brain function and overall well-being. Limiting screen time and promoting interactive learning experiences may also help in reducing attention-related difficulties."
